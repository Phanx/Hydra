Description

	Hydra is a multibox leveling helper that aims to minimize the number
	of times you need to actively control secondary characters.

Usage

	Type "/hydra" for options, or browse to the Hydra panel in the
	standard Interface Options window.

	Many of Hydra's features are only active in parties consisting of
	characters on your "trusted" list, or only respond to characters on
	this list. The first time you run Hydra, you will need to define
	this list in the options panel.

Features

	Core:

	* Automatically enables or disables features depending on whether or
	  not the current party consists of trusted characters.

	Automation:

	* Accepts resurrections and summons.
	* Declines duels, guilds, and arena teams.
	* Repairs equipment and sells junk to vendors.
	* Hold Shift to bypass repairing and selling.
	* Type "/release" to have all dead party members release spirit. [NYI]
	* Type "/corpse" to have all ghost party members accept corpse. [NYI]

	Chat:

	* Forwards whispers to secondary characters to party chat.
	* Forwards responses from party chat back to the original whisperer
	  as a whisper from the character they messaged.
	* Messages in party chat that do not being with "@" or "!" are
	  assumed to be a response to the last forwarded whisper.
	* Type "@partymember message here" in party chat to respond to the
	  last message forwarded to party chat by "partymember".
	* Type "@target message here" in a whisper to a trusted character to
	  have that character whisper "message here" to the player "target".

	Follow:

	* Notifies you when a party member starts or stops following you.
	* Type "/followme" to have all party members follow you.

	Mount:

	* Mounts other party members when you mount.

	Party:

	* Accepts party invitations from trusted characters.
	* Type "/inviteme" to request a party invitation from your target.
	* Type "/inviteme name" to request a party invitation from "name".

	* Accepts quests shared by players.
	* Accepts start confirmations for escort-type quests.
	* Abandons quests abandoned by trusted party members.
	* Accepts quests from NPCs that another party member accepted.
	* Turns in completed quests that don't have reward choices.

	Taxi:

	* Selects the last taxi node selected by another party member in the
	  last 60 seconds.
	* Type "/cleartaxi" to clear the taxi selection for the character.
	* Hold Shift when speaking to a flight master to bypass autoselect.

Localization

	Hydra has full support for localization, but has not yet been
	translated into any languages but English. However, it should still
	be compatible with all locales.

	If you can provide translations for any locale, please contact us.
