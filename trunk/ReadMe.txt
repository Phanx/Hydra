## Description

Hydra is a multibox leveling helper that aims to minimize the number of
times you need to actively control secondary characters.

## Usage

Type "/hydra" for options, or browse to the Hydra panel in the
standard Interface Options window.

Many of Hydra's features are only active in parties consisting of
characters on your "trusted" list, or only respond to characters on
this list. The first time you run Hydra, you will need to define
this list in the options panel.


## Features

### Core

* Automatically enables or disables features depending on whether or
  not the current party consists of trusted characters.

### Automation

* Accepts resurrections and summons.
* Declines duels, guilds, and arena teams.
* Repairs equipment and sells junk to vendors.
* Hold Shift to bypass repairing and selling.
* Type "/release" to have all dead party members release spirit. [NYI]
* Type "/corpse" to have all ghost party members accept corpse. [NYI]

### Chat

* Forwards whispers to secondary characters to party chat.
* Forwards responses from party chat back to the original whisperer
  as a whisper from the character they messaged.
* Messages in party chat that do not being with "@" or "!" are
  assumed to be a response to the last forwarded whisper.
* Type "@partymember message here" in party chat to respond to the
  last message forwarded to party chat by "partymember".
* Type "@target message here" in a whisper to a trusted character to
  have that character whisper "message here" to the player "target".

* Notifies you when a party member starts or stops following you.
* Command all party members to follow you by typing "/followme".
* Command dead party members to release their spirit by typing
  "/corpse release".

  soulstone or other self-resurrection ability) by typing "/corpse
  accept".

* Mounts other party members when you mount.

### Party

  last 60 seconds.
* Type "/cleartaxi" to clear the taxi selection for the character.
* Hold Shift when speaking to a flight master to bypass autoselect.


## Localization

Hydra has full support for localization, but has not yet been
translated into any languages but English. However, it should still
be compatible with all locales.

If you can provide translations for any locale, send me a PM.
